Description: @wizards@ is a package designed for the quick and painless development of /interrogative/ programs, which
  revolve around a \"dialogue\" with the user, who is asked a series of questions in a sequence much like an 
  installation wizard.
  .
  Everything from interactive system scripts, to installation wizards, to full-blown shells can be implemented with
  the support of @wizards@.
  .
  It is developed transparently on top of a free monad, which separates out the semantics of the program from any
  particular interface. A variety of backends exist, including console-based "System.Console.Wizard.Haskeline" and 
  "System.Console.Wizard.BasicIO", and the pure "System.Console.Wizard.Pure". It is also possible to write your 
  own backends, or extend existing back-ends with new features. While both built-in IO backends operate on a
  console, there is no reason why @wizards@ cannot also be used for making GUI wizard interfaces.
  .
  .
  See the github page for examples on usage:
  .
  <http://www.github.com/liamoc/wizards>
  .
  For creating backends, the module "System.Console.Wizard.Internal" has a brief tutorial.
